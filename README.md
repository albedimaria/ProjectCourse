# ProjectCourse
Generation of Wave Digital Filters from SPICE Netlist (H9000 required)

Simulations of generic circuits in the Wave Digital (WD) domain (e.g., for Virtual Analog applications) lack a graphical interface for setting up the circuit schematic. The project aims at exploiting the graphical interface of LTspice (a circuit simulation software) in order to generate Wave Digital Filters in an automatic fashion. 

For simplicity, the class of circuits you will have to deal with is restricted to passive linear audio filters.

Softwares: Matlab, LTSpice.
