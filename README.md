Implementation of Wave Digital Filter on Eventide H9000

The Eventide H9000 is known to deliver industry-leading signal processing power to the pro audio community. Thanks to VSig3 (an Eventide software), H9000 users are able to create their own effects exploiting predefined modules. The aim of the project is to implement an H9000 effect based on Wave Digital Filters.

Softwares: Matlab, VSig3.
